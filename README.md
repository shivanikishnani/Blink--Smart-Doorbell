# Blink--Smart-Doorbell
Security, connection, convenience.  A doorbell add-on that upon sensing movement, captures a picture and takes an audio recording till the motion ceases. Additionally, it permits communication between the visitor and the home-owner by allowing visitors to send texts in case they arrive in the absence of the home-owner. The home-owner also has a secure button-operated command on their phone to open a compartment in the doorbell body that they can use to store things in.
